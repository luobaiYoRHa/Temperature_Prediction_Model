# Temperature Prediction Using Neural Networks

This project involves developing and implementing a neural network model to predict maximum daily temperatures using historical weather data. The model is built and trained using PyTorch, with mini-batch gradient descent for efficient and scalable training.

## Features
- Fully connected neural network using PyTorch
- Mini-batch gradient descent for efficient training
- Data normalization and feature engineering with pandas and NumPy
- Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Visualization of actual vs. predicted values using Matplotlib
